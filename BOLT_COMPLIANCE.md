## 🎯 **Why Backend is External**

**Simple Answer**: Multi-agent AI coordination requires Python's async/await patterns for parallel processing.

### **Technical Reality:**
```
❌ Bolt.new Limitations:        ✅ Python Backend Handles:
• 30+ second AI operations      • Parallel OpenAI API calls  
• 100MB+ PDF processing         • Multi-agent coordination
• Audio file generation         • Background job queues
• Complex document parsing      • Error handling & retries
```

### **Architecture:**
```
👤 USER → 🎨 BOLT.NEW FRONTEND → 🔌 API → 🤖 PYTHON BACKEND
         (100% user experience)           (AI orchestration)
```
